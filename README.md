# SMS Spam Classifier

## Overview
This project aims to classify SMS messages as either spam or non-spam (ham) using machine learning techniques. By analyzing the content of the messages, the classifier can help identify and filter out unwanted spam messages from legitimate ones.

## Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset consisting of labeled SMS messages, with each message categorized as either spam or ham. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to train the classifier and evaluate its performance.

## Model Architecture
The SMS spam classifier employs a variety of natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including tokenization, text preprocessing, and feature extraction. It utilizes machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to learn patterns and classify messages accurately.

## Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the classifier is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into how well the classifier distinguishes between spam and ham messages and its overall effectiveness in spam detection.

## Usage
To use the SMS spam classifier:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the provided Jupyter notebook or Python script to train the classifier and make predictions on new SMS messages.

## Future Improvements
Potential enhancements to the project include:
- Experimenting with different machine learning algorithms to improve classification accuracy.
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters and text preprocessing techniques for better performance.
- Exploring advanced NLP models or ensemble methods to handle complex text data more effectively.
